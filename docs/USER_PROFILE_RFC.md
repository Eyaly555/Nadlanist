# User Profile Features RFC

## Short Summary

This RFC proposes the implementation of user profile features for cursor.new, allowing users to create, view, and edit their profiles, as well as visit other users' profiles using username-based navigation. This feature will enhance user engagement and enable better collaboration between users on the platform.

## Background and Motivation

- Currently, users can authenticate but lack personalized profile features
- Username-based navigation is needed for easy user discovery and sharing
- Profile customization will help users establish their identity on the platform
- This feature is foundational for future social and collaboration features

## Technical Architecture

### API Routes

```typescript
// app/api/profiles/[username]/route.ts
GET / api / profiles / [username]; // Get public profile
PUT / api / profiles / [username]; // Update profile (authenticated user only)
```

### Page Routes

```
app/
  (profile)/
    /[username]/
      page.tsx      // Public profile view
      edit/
        page.tsx    // Profile edit page (protected)
```

### Components Structure

```typescript
components / profile / ProfileView.tsx; // Public profile display
ProfileEditForm.tsx; // Profile editing form
ProfileHeader.tsx; // Profile header with avatar
ProfileSocials.tsx; // Social links section
```

### Authentication & Authorization

- Profile editing restricted to profile owner
- Public profiles viewable by all users
- Rate limiting on profile updates

### Performance Considerations

- Cache profile data using React Query
- Optimize avatar image loading with Next.js Image
- Implement progressive loading for profile sections

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. ID-based Profile URLs

- Pros: Simpler implementation, no username conflicts
- Cons: Less user-friendly, harder to share/remember
- Decision: Using existing username field for better UX

### 2. Separate Profile Service

- Pros: Better separation of concerns
- Cons: Additional complexity, not needed at current scale
- Decision: Keep within main Supabase database for simplicity

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Profile Features

1. Add database migrations for new profile fields (bio and social links)
2. Implement profile API endpoints
3. Create basic profile view/edit components

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features

1. Add social links integration
2. Enhance avatar upload UX with image optimization
3. Add profile customization options

### Phase 3: Social Features

1. Add profile activity feed
2. Implement follow/unfollow functionality
3. Add profile discovery features

## Additional Considerations

### Security

- Sanitize all user-provided content
- Implement rate limiting for profile updates
- Add CSRF protection for profile edits

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for profile components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for profile workflows
- Load testing for profile views

### Monitoring

- Track profile view/edit metrics
- Track avatar storage usage
- Profile update error rates

### Documentation Needs

- API documentation for profile endpoints
- User guide for profile features
- Internal docs for profile policies
- Migration guide for existing users
